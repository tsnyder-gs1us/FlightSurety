## Develop Client

To run truffle tests:

## Notes To Review

DAPP Front End Application is setup to demonstrate the following functionality 
    -- Setup Airlines and Flights (This Happens On Initialize of Application)
    -- Allow Passenger to Purchase Flight Insurance
    -- Check Flight Info (Triggers Call to Oracle)
    -- Check Credit Balance From Delayed Flights
    
Notes:
    -- DAPP is setup to always use the same passenger 
    -- DAPP checks to see if App Contract has been authorized to call Data Contract
    -- Before Running Tests make sure to setup test accounts testConfig.js
    -- Before Deploying Contracts make sure to set first airline account in 2_deploy_contracts.js
